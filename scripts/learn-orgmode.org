#+TITLE: Org-Mode Crash Course
#+AUTHOR: Tom Harry
#+STARTUP: overview

* 📋 Basics of Org-Mode

Org files are plain text but powerful. Headings use asterisks:

* This is a heading
** This is a subheading
*** You can go deeper

Use `TAB` to fold/unfold sections.

* ✅ TODOs and Checkboxes

** TODO Learn Emacs basics
** DONE Install Doom Emacs
** TODO Setup Org-mode agenda

- [x] Install org-roam
- [ ] Understand headings
- [ ] Practice capture templates

* 🕒 Scheduling

** TODO Finish Doom setup
   SCHEDULED: <2025-07-12 Sat>
   DEADLINE: <2025-07-15 Tue>

* 📌 Tags and Metadata

** TODO Write blog post     :writing:blog:
** DONE Submit assignment   :school:

Use `C-c C-c` on tags to update.

* 📚 Notes and Links

You can add links like this: [[https://orgmode.org][Org-mode Docs]]

Use `M-RET` to insert new items at the same level.

* 💻 Code Blocks

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print("Hello from Org-mode!")
print("how are you today")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: None

You can execute with `C-c C-c` inside the block.

* 🗓️ Agenda View

Use `SPC m a` to open the agenda. It shows:

- Scheduled tasks
- Deadlines
- TODOs across files

* 🧠 Practice Challenges

** TODO Create your own task list
** TODO Add a scheduled task
** TODO Make a project section with subtasks
** TODO Insert and run a Python code block

* This is a heading if i can
** and it this this is a sub headding
** this is a second sub heading
* this is just another normall heading
** this is a second
*** and now this is a third heading
