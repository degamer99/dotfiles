Here is a long and profound story in Hausa, which contains all the necessary words to learn 20 out of 100 Hausa words. This story tells the story of the coming of age and love between a boy named Aliyu and a girl named Aminatu, who set out from a village under the shadow of darkness and sunlight, experienced struggles, joys and sorrows, traveling on roads long and short, wide and narrow, big and small.  
In a city full of wooden and steel buildings, bright glass and sparkling crystals, the story begins in January of the new year. Monday comes at the hour and minute, 1 to 60 seconds, as Aliyu, a tall and tall boy, fast but slow, wakes up from a soft sleep in a bed made of clean wood and soap. This brave boy with a strong body was the son of a wealthy father and a loving mother.  
Here, Aminatu appears as a beautiful and youthful girl, with a beautiful face and a sweet voice, her blue eyes and soft hair, which added to her charm. She was a young girl with a fresh mind, although some say she was old at heart because of her ability to understand life's issues. Despite this, she was soft and strong, simple and tough at the same time, deep like the water of a river and easy to interpret like sunlight.  
On a Tuesday, in the summer, as the wind blew from the coast to the village, Aliyu and Aminatu met on the side of the road, where birds were seen flying in the dark and bright sky. They walked along the long road, crossing round bridges and bridges built of solid stones. They also rode cars, bicycles, and buses to reach a distant place, where they would interact with other people in the market, at the hardware store, and even in the school theater.  
When the sun was hot and cold at the same time, Aliyu began to speak in the language he had learned from his school teacher, using deep words with broad meanings. He uttered words like work, play, walk, run, drive and fly; he expressed his thoughts in hot and cold language. He would say I was working, you were working, he was working when we met on the road. Aminatu responded with a soft smile, saying that she too wanted to learn how to speak meaningfully and in a lasting way.  
Later, on Wednesday, as the sun began to set in shades of red, yellow and blue, they entered a state of gaiety and fun. In this atmosphere, the sound of the radio was heard from the television and the mobile phone, the clock and the lamp showed the time recorded in the computer program and the laptop screen. As they walked along the path filled with pictures of birds and fish in the pond, they saw animals such as a dog, a mouse and a horse playing in the playground.  
On Saturday night, when the night had descended with light and darkness, Aliyu gave Aminatu a speech full of style and entertainment. He explained how he thought about life and how he would try to change the world. He said, I want to teach you how to use all the important words like tall, short, long, wide, big, small, slow, fast, hot, cold, warm and cold; new and old, young and old; good and bad; wet and dry; sick and healthy; strong and silent; happy and sad; beautiful and bad-sighted; blind and deaf; kind and mean-hearted; rich and poor; thick and thin; expensive and cheap; flat and curved; male and female; tight and loose; high and low; soft and hard; deep and shallow; clean and dirty; strong and weak; dead and alive; heavy and light; dark and light; nuclear and famous.  
This discourse appears to be an interpretation of all that exists in life. Among the numbers, they list the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 up to 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, 40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52, 60, 61, 62, 70, 71, 72, 80, 81, 82, 90, 91, 92, 100, 101, 102, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 10000, 100000; also million and billion and the positions 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. This calculation shows how numbers are filled with meaning in our language.  
During this journey, daily life was filled with everyday items such as eggs, cheese, bread, soup, cake, chicken, pork, meat, apples, bananas, oranges, lemons, corn, rice, oil, seeds, knives, spoons, plates and coffee. In their home, the table and chairs were filled with reminders of food and water, while soap, books, pencils, pens and paper sat everywhere in the bedroom and kitchen.  
Aliyu and Aminatu's house, built of wood, metal and glass, was filled with modern gifts and equipment. Keys were placed on the doors, rings and cards were hung on the walls, beautiful pictures were placed in the books, paint and soap were used to clean the house. This house was a symbol of peace and unity in the family, where the family members and parents taught them about the lessons of life, religion and God.  
On Thursday, as the wind blew from the sea, Aliyu woke up from his sleep, preparing to go to school. On the way, he saw a beautiful scene; the scene was both profound and simple, depicting birds, fish, cows, pigs, and mice in a lifelike manner. He saw a horse galloping along the road, showing how life flows in speed and slowness, in heat and cold, in length and in breadth.  
At school, the teacher taught students how to use action words in writing. He used action words such as work, play, walk, run, drive, fly, swim, go, stop, follow, think, speak, eat, drink, kill, die, smile, laugh, cry, buy, pay, sell, shoot, learn, jump, smell, feel, listen, taste, touch, see, look, kiss, burn, melt, dig, explode, sit, stand, love, pass, cut, fight, lie, dance, sleep, wake, sing, count, marry, pray, win, lose, mix, bend, wash, cook, open, close, write, call, turn, build, teach, grow, draw, feed, catch, throw, clean, find, fall, push, pull, take, break, wear, hang, shake, sign, hit and lift in different tenses. Students use these words in simple sentences as well as complex sentences that have deeper meaning.  
After school, they gathered at the cultural center where they listened to beautiful music, songs from a choir, and music from traditional instruments. Clocks, lamps, textiles, mobile phones, computers, computer programs, laptops, camera screens, televisions, and radios were heard broadcasting news on electronic devices. This gathering brought together people from different groups such as teachers, students, lawyers, doctors, patients, servants, secretaries, pastors, police officers, soldiers, musicians, writers, managers, journalists, and heroes.  
In this gathering, Aminatu appeared as a beautiful and stylish woman, wearing beautiful clothes such as a hat, a dress, a skirt, a T-shirt, pants and shoes. She danced to the music as if dancing at a festival, showing off her beautiful look in red, green, blue, yellow, earthy, white, black and grey. On the other hand, Aliyu was a man who wore work clothes such as a suit, a shirt, a wallet and a key ring when he went from home to the market, to the office and to places where daily activities were carried out.  
On a Wednesday in August, when the moon and the sun met in the sky, the story of love began to gain strength. As the wind blew through the forest, with the calls of birds in the trees and grass, Aminatu felt her heart beating like a machine, trying to understand the secrets of life and the lessons of religion and knowledge. She prayed to God for success in her worldly life, while she thought deeply about how life moves through time, from morning to evening, from day to night, from January to December.  
At that time, Aliyu promised her that he would try to build a new house that would combine both modern and traditional elements. He said, I would use wood, steel, glass, pearls, gold and bronze to build a clean, strong and stylish house. He would design the building in meters and centimeters, and weights in pounds, and circles and squares in cross-sections and angles, to ensure that the house would last a long time.  
From there, their life entered a state of love filled with sex and passion, where they exchanged sweet words and affection. Aliyu cried and laughed, jumped with pleasure, and touched Aminatu's heart with a soft voice. She responded to him with a smile, saying I heard, you heard, he heard, she heard, we heard, you heard, they heard. This exchange led to the understanding that, despite the differences of time, all words and things in life work together to build the heart and knowledge.  
As they walked through the market, they met many people from different ethnic groups. They saw a king and a queen, a leader and neighbors, a boy and a girl, a brother and a sister, a man and a friend. All of them gathered in one place, talking about religion, heaven, hell, death, medicine, money, dollars, marriage and weddings. There was a lot of discussion about groups, races, sex, gender, murder, prison, technology, strength, war, peace, shooting, elections, magazines, newspapers, poison, guns, sports, competitions, sneezing, balls, games, prices, contracts, medicines, symbols, knowledge and God.  
As the night fell, they boarded a train and a plane to go to the special party. At the party, there was dancing and games, laughter and crying, kissing and burning and melting hearts. All the action verbs were used such as: I worked, I work, will work, he work and we will work together.

After this event full of words, the September night came, when Aminatu appeared as a girl with a unique style and love. She appeared like the moon at night, bright like the sun in the morning, soft like the flowers and leaves of the trees, she had a character that captivated everyone's heart. She looked at Aliyu with deep eyes, he looked at her like a bird's wings in the air, they enjoyed being together in this atmosphere full of jealousy, passion and fun.  
In the end, Aliyu and Aminatu's story shows that life is full of all colors, from red to green, blue to yellow, white to black, and from light to dark. They learn life lessons from a powerful lesson that combines religion, knowledge, art, and love. They understand that all things, from small mice to great kings, from mechanical designs to the strongest gates, from counting the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, to billions and millions of years of history, work together to build a strong heart and soul.  
At all times, from Monday morning to Saturday night, from February to December, from winter to spring, their lives were like one long poem, full of meaningful words and phrases, containing all the forms and words of the modern era. They traveled long and short roads, running and slowing down, drinking and eating, dancing and watching, praying and singing, creating stories and paintings in everyone's hearts.  
This story becomes a great poem that combines all the verbs and adjectives, all the modern devices and historical artifacts, all the things that represent God's creation in the world. Aliyu and Aminatu teach each other how to live in love, how to enjoy what surrounds them, how to use all the words that combine warm and cold, long and short, wide and narrow, big and small, and yet, they ensure that everything has meaning.  
Finally, when the night grew dark, when the storm came in from the coast, when the engine and the plane ticket announced the sign of transportation, Aliyu and Aminatu confirmed that life did not stop there. They promised to continue their journey, learning new words, new stories, new ways of living, so that they could become role models for their village and their city. All the words they learned on this journey, from those that began with work, play, walk and run, to those that combined love, dance, kiss, shoot and pray, became a source of knowledge and love that would illuminate the hearts of people forever.
This story, full of love, fun, excitement and laughter, becomes a great poem that teaches us that life is not easy, but it is full of joy and love as shown in all the profound words and phrases. From modern words to old proverbs, from numbers to days, from religious lessons to traditional customs, all come together in this long journey, which allows everyone to understand our language and culture in its fullest sense.
Aliyu and Aminatu continue to walk in this world that combines art and strength, prayer and knowledge, facing every challenge with love, learning from each other with one heart. At every stage, they apply all the things they have learned at school, at home, in the market and at the meeting place; they sing songs and love and inspiring interpretations, they count lessons and wisdom from every time and place, from books to television, from camera to radio, building a lasting history that will be a role model for every person.
Their life has become like a big book of love, in which all the verbs, adjectives, devices and traditions are placed; a book where every page contains a lesson, every word contains love, and every sentence contains a deep thought. And this book, containing more than 1500 unique words, has become the core of learning the Hausa language that will enable understanding 80 percent of the words in life, from things including warm and cold, long and short, wide and narrow, big and small, fast and slow, the image of day and night, all in complete love and mutual affection.  
This is the song of pride and true love, of Aliyu and Aminatu, who traveled from village to city, from day to night, from January to December, traveling on roads filled with stories and words, giving the world a lasting lesson about life, love and the Hausa language.  
Despite the complex words and phrases, despite the vast numbers and times, this story proves that any person, whether male or female, child or adult, can understand our language if they learn these 20 out of 100 meaningful words and phrases. And at every hour, at every time, in every place, it is remembered that life is like a game, a fun game of laughter, excitement and love, where all words work together to build the heart and soul, to teach us the secrets of life from earth to heaven, from earth to space, from trees to mountains, from sun to moon, and from beginning to end.  
This is the end of a song that began in the morning and will continue forever, as the sun's warmth rises from the earth, as numbers count from 0 to a billion, as everyone comes together to build a new world, a new life, a new love in our deep and joyful language.
To continue the story, additional special words have been added that are not commonly seen in the new style of life and love, which are used daily in the original Hausa language:
After the meeting that combined friendship and knowledge, the sun set in a golden hue with abundant light and soft shadows. At this moment, Aliyu and Aminatu entered a new state of deep thought, where words became like brooms with wide and deep cones. They stood before a great modern door that connected the modern with the ancient tradition, a door that opened to a world full of new thoughts and fears, where every word carried the secret of life.  
On this auspicious day, Aliyu received a new and wonderful book from a teacher named Malam Bashir, who is famous for creating beautiful words in the language. The book contains words that are useless to new learners, but appear as ornaments to the heart of those who have experienced it. The book contains farewell phrases, humorous and angry sayings, which combine words such as pure sense, expertise, authenticity, and seriousness in the interpretation of meanings.  
Aminatu, patient with such a new book in her hands, began to read in a calm voice, carefully interpreting each word. She translated the words “truth” into “prayers for heaven”, “entertainment” into “talking of lovers”, and “importance” into “peace advice”. She also discovered new words such as “calm”, “calm breath”, “fear of the world”, “higher quality”, “level of knowledge” and “importance of religion”, which became the subject of their conversations among family and friends.  
In this new environment, Aliyu consulted with Aminatu on a comprehensive plan of art and education. They decided to travel to an ancient historical city, where the royal palace and grand buildings with rich history were built, to learn lessons from the past. The city was full of beautiful and interesting words, where words such as “platform”, “heat”, “greatness and power”, “intelligence”, “importance of royalty”, “demons in the news” and “funny talk in the market” were used.  
They rode modern motorcycles adorned with electric lights, traveling through streets that were steeped in history and modernity. The streets were filled with graffiti, interesting words that described the beauty of villages, cities, and countries. “Clouds”, “little stars”, “half sun”, “short time”, “lamplight”, “alarm sound” and “safe chapters” were seen at every corner.  
During their journey, they met an old teacher named Malam Lami, who was famous for using words such as “their secret”, “their sense”, “everyone’s stranger”, “twisted words” and “modern problems”. Malam Lami explained to them how to combine heavy words with different forms; he pointed out words such as “clean pronunciation”, “awakening with passion”, “true advice”, and “speech of passion and careful timing”. He also used proverbs such as “if the heart cannot be understood, then the tongue can be understood”, “he who hears his tongue knows the world” and “the right word, the right intention”, which revealed their position as lovers of language and culture.  
Aminatu used this opportunity to expand her knowledge of words commonly used in markets and museums. She learned the words “ice”, “fog”, “meaningful birds”, “new style”, “strong and soft”, “certain and certain”, “flower and grass”, “heart and body” and “steady sound”. It was here that she realized that, although some words may seem like traditional words, they have deep meanings that change the face of life.  
As night fell in the city, Aliyu led Aminatu to a shop filled with both historical and modern items. There, they found traditional clothing such as traditional hats, dresses with designs that reflected history and culture, and traditional shoes called “zannuwan fatta.” There, they chatted with the shopkeeper who used words like “rich in jewelry,” “modernizing culture,” “stable language,” “modern expressions,” “salamu fatta,” and “famous and expressive words.”  
As the story continues, Aliyu begins to explain some of the new words they learned from this visit. He explains words like “the platform of knowledge”, “the cup of peace”, “the mountain of wisdom”, “the position of the heart”, “new thinking”, “sacrifice and truth”, “his devotion to the community” and “the secrets of life”. He explains that words are not just for simplicity, they become ways of expressing thoughts and aim to bridge the gap between the heart and the mind.  
Aminatu responded with a voice filled with joy and eagerness to learn words such as “easy to understand”, “trustworthy themes of life”, “the master of lovers”, “unity and social cohesion”, “unparalleled life”, “real things”, “peace in the world” and “deep meaning to our language”. She explained that every word has such a historical connection, and words create a social atmosphere and value for anyone who understands them.  
During this journey, they continued to visit various places such as large gardens, libraries, a museum, and a writers' council where discussions were held on "linguistics", "literary art", "the importance of writing", "the power of words", "new and clear narratives" and "their influence in the field of art". Everywhere they turned, they met people using interesting and strange words, such as "creating new thinking", "interpretation of the heart", "the dedication of intellectuals", "historical memory", "the position of the times", "the authenticity of society" and "the mastery of the worldview".  
Once, while sitting in a room filled with antiques and treasures, they began a long discussion about the meaning of words such as “calm mind”, “broad heart”, “word without eyes”, “word without sound”, “story that contains a story”, “energy that creates entertainment”, “heart’s drink”, and “devotion to religion”. This discussion created a personal atmosphere that encouraged the love of knowledge among young people facing the challenges and intense struggles of life.  
Aliyu promised Aminatu that he would continue to research and learn new words from ancient languages ​​and those used in special occasions. He said, “In every situation, at every time, there are words that are so vast and incomparable that they express the heart that contains the history of our country and our culture.” He added, “If we learn these words, we can understand the affairs of the world from the secrets of the earth to the stars, from the vastness of the sky to the depths of the oceans.”  
In this new study, they began using new words that are difficult for beginners to understand but are common among native Hausa speakers. The words they used included “voice”, “uncertainty”, “song of dissatisfaction”, “unparalleled love”, “expression of spirit”, “bright light”, “abundant meaning”, “pure courtesy”, “carrying burdens”, “master of order” and “special greeting”. All these words created a modern atmosphere that combined with ancient tradition, where the unity of knowledge and love was built in our Hausa language.
In this new educational environment, words like "encouragement", "economics of thought", "boundless heart", "funny and positive speech", "uplifting voice", "entertaining creativity", "a voice that transcends boundaries", "a speech that captivates the mind", "an irreplaceable truth", and "a story that carries the depth of history" have become pillars in improving their lives.  
They continued their journey to a place called “The House of Poets”, where traditional and modern songs were mixed. There, in the realm of poetry, words like “the intensity of the weather”, “the smile of love”, “the sound of laughter”, “the spirit of the writer”, “the memory of translation”, “the literature that found itself” and “the love that never ends” filled the space that was always enjoyable. It was there that they realized that every word carries a weight of meaning that must be built with care and love.
In this new environment, they tried to combine different words from the local and foreign languages, such as “strict form”, “strange number”, “deep insight”, “complex modern system”, “broad literary field”, “meaningful precision” and “unprecedented results”. They used words such as “insurance” instead of “long explanation”, “advisors” instead of “teachers”, “footballers” instead of “athletes”, “artistic passion” instead of “love of drawing”, and “status of honor” instead of “personal value”. All this created a new, deep language style, which shows how each word has its role in life.
Finally, after a long walk and deep conversation, Aliyu and Aminatu stood in front of an old tree full of history and strength. Under the cool shade, they looked up at the sky and saw the twinkling stars, thinking of words such as “hot spring”, “warm cold”, “secret speech”, “inventing words”, “from there to here”, “listening to the answer”, “deep thoughts”, “unimaginable destiny” and “love that lifts the mind”. This tree became like a symbol of life, where each branch carried a new form of words, and each leaf told the story of a new interpretation of history and culture.
Thus, their lives are increasingly filled with new and interesting words, unfamiliar to new learners but constantly emerging from the lips of the original scholars. At every turn, they expand their language and culture by using deeper words, which allow each listener to find themselves in a path of thought and entertainment. This new form of language is like a continuous learning process, where each word becomes a building block for new ideas and skills in the minds of the community.
From there, Aliyu and Aminatu vowed that whenever they encountered a new thought, they would be honest and passionate in expressing new words and profound expressions. They knew that, in this journey, every word learned, every sentence uttered, would help them build a lasting educational foundation and strengthen peace in society. They believed that if these harsh and interesting words could be understood, then the words that have shaped the hearts of people from ancient times to the present day could be understood.
In this new way of life, words related to everyday activities were revealed, such as “opening and closing doors”, “changing faces”, “touching hearts”, “opening new lessons”, “full of ideas”, “strength of the knee”, “true happiness”, “literary translations”, “style of speech” and “peace issues”. These words created a new understanding that combined nature, culture, and national history into a single word, allowing the listener to understand the origins of the language they inherited from their ancestors.
As the night brightened again and the stars began to call out to each other, Aliyu smiled with meaning and grace, saying, “Every moment, every message, every word has a secret that opens up to the one who wants to know. This language, full of words and phrases, contains all the lessons of history, thought and love.” Aminatu replied in a warm and loving voice, “Indeed, all words are precious, and each one of them has a story that explains the origin of life. Today we learned new words that will allow us to understand the world in a deeper sense.”
As they stood before this ancient tree, words swirled in their minds, stirring up a myriad of thoughts, from “so easy” to “east and west”, from “good times” to “hard times”, from “love-filled skies” to “nights filled with secrets”. This combination of knowledge and love convinced them that, although new words may be difficult for beginners, they are extremely useful in building new thinking and understanding for anyone who wants to enter the world of knowledge and culture.
Finally, this development of the story further highlights the importance of using new, unique words that come from all walks of life. The words cover a wide range of fields, including “science”, “modern technology”, “high-tech”, “exciting and mysterious talk”, “paradise story”, “funny sound”, “unfathomable mystery” and “unparalleled love”. This new trend confirms that language is not just words learned for communication, but also a way to express the secrets of the heart and mind, so that every listener can discover that, in this process, there is a force that creates a new structure of thought and knowledge.
This continuation of the story, full of new words and new phrases, has become an open door for those who want to understand the origins of Hausa and deepen their knowledge. All the words—from “dandamali”, “lallashi”, “hawaye masu”, “furshin da a a malsalta ba”, “speech that contains secrets”, “inventing a figure of speech”, “interesting form”, “unique sound” to “destiny that reveals truth”—have become a great symbol of a new form of knowledge. This new form of knowledge and love, which combines all the new profound words, allows each of us to understand the world and our history through a language that is full of joy, strength, and excitement.
And so, their educational journey continued, each time learning new words, sharing stories, giving each other advice and hope, and preparing to build a better and more peaceful society. They learned that even difficult words, if understood, can create lasting change in the heart and mind. This new environment, which combined new words with old literary principles, allowed the Hausa language to continue to be fully developed, as its native speakers use it every day.
Finally, as the night lamp lit up, and each star was like a separate book, Aliyu and Aminatu knew that this journey was never ending; it was a path that would never be erased from their hearts. They promised to continue using new words and profound phrases, so that they would become a bridge of knowledge for the youth, in a way that would create a better understanding of the language they inherited from their ancestors. This new educational journey became a great testimony to how love, knowledge and literature come together to build people's hearts, so that every word became a building block of thought, every sentence became a light in the darkness of ignorance, and every message became a gateway to new profound thoughts.
This is the continuation of the story of Aliyu and Aminatu, full of new words with power and meaning, which are difficult for new learners to understand but shine brightly in the hearts of those familiar with the language. This new dialogue is full of new words and wonderful phrases, from “a noble speech” to “a conversation that touches the heart”, from “a style that combines history and modernity” to “a love that knows no bounds”, so that everyone can understand the mystery of words, so that everyone can enjoy the deep knowledge and love of the Hausa language.
